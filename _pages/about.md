<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Geodesy and Surveying Engineering at Chang‚Äôan University, College of Geological Engineering and Geomatics. My research focuses on imaging geodesy and earthquake observation.

I utilize multi-source observations ‚Äî such as geodetic data (e.g., InSAR, GNSS) and seismological data (e.g., aftershock relocation, strong-motion, and teleseismic waveforms) ‚Äî together with various modeling techniques (e.g., finite-fault inversion, back-projection) to investigate and better understand source fault structures, rupture dynamics, and stress triggering mechanisms of catastrophic earthquakes. In addition, I am dedicated to compiling a global InSAR seismic catalogue and developing a shared system of global InSAR seismic fault models, which will provide valuable references for future seismic hazard research.

More importantly, I am deeply interested in rapid response and timely research on global catastrophic events. I have been engaged in emergency studies of earthquakes both in China and abroad, including co-seismic fault modeling and analysis of the 2022 Menyuan earthquake, 2022 Luding earthquake, 2022 Taitung earthquake sequence, 2023 T√ºrkiye earthquake sequence, 2023 Herat earthquake sequence, 2023 Jishishan earthquake, 2024 Wushi earthquake, and 2024 Hualien earthquake. I have also participated in field investigations for the 2022 Menyuan earthquake, 2022 Luding earthquake, and 2023 Jishishan earthquake.
