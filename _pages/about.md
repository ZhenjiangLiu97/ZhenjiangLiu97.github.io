<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Geodesy and Surveying Engineering at Chang’an University, College of Geological Engineering and Geomatics. My research focuses on imaging geodesy and earthquake observation.

I utilize multi-source observations — such as geodetic data (e.g., InSAR, GNSS) and seismological data (e.g., aftershock relocation, strong-motion, and teleseismic waveforms) — together with various modeling techniques (e.g., finite-fault inversion, back-projection) to investigate and better understand source fault structures, rupture dynamics, and stress triggering mechanisms of catastrophic earthquakes. In addition, I am dedicated to compiling a global InSAR seismic catalogue and developing a shared system of global InSAR seismic fault models, which will provide valuable references for future seismic hazard research.

More importantly, I am deeply interested in rapid response and timely research on global catastrophic events. I have been engaged in emergency studies of earthquakes both in China and abroad, including co-seismic fault modeling and analysis of the 2022 Menyuan earthquake, 2022 Luding earthquake, 2022 Taitung earthquake sequence, 2023 Türkiye earthquake sequence, 2023 Herat earthquake sequence, 2023 Jishishan earthquake, 2024 Wushi earthquake, and 2024 Hualien earthquake. I have also participated in field investigations for the 2022 Menyuan earthquake, 2022 Luding earthquake, and 2023 Jishishan earthquake.
